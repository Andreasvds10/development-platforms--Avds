- **2015**: Netlify is launched, offering continuous deployment and other advanced features tailored for modern web development.
- **2016**: Netlify gains popularity for its ease of use and powerful integration with build tools and APIs.
- **2019**: GitHub Pages introduces more customization options, while Netlify expands its feature set with serverless functions and more.

## Main Features

### Netlify Features:
- **Continuous Deployment:** Netlify automatically deploys changes pushed to your GitHub or GitLab repositories.

## Market Comparison

Netlify offers a more feature-rich platform with continuous deployment, serverless functions, and advanced build tools. It's especially suited for modern web development workflows. On the other hand, GitHub Pages is a simpler, no-frills option for hosting static sites directly from GitHub repositories.

- **Netlify vs GitHub Pages**: Netlify is ideal for developers who need advanced features such as serverless functions, automated deployments, and integrations with modern build tools. GitHub Pages, however, is a better choice for developers who want a free, simple way to host a static website directly from their GitHub repository.

## Getting Started

To get started with Netlify, you can sign up for a free account at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and connect your GitHub repository. Netlify will automatically build and deploy your site upon each commit.

For GitHub Pages, you can create a GitHub repository, push your static site files, and enable GitHub Pages under the repository settings. GitHub will serve the static site directly from the repository.

## Conclusion

Netlify and GitHub Pages are both excellent platforms for hosting static websites, with distinct advantages depending on your project needs. Netlify offers more features and flexibility for complex projects, while GitHub Pages provides a simpler, free solution for basic static sites.
