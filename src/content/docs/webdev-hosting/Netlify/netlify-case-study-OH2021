# 🚀 CASE STUDY: NETLIFY WEB HOSTING

---

## 📌 INTRODUCTION

**Netlify** is a modern web hosting and automation platform designed specifically for frontend developers. It simplifies the process of deploying static websites and single-page applications by integrating **CI/CD**, custom domains, **HTTPS**, and **serverless functions** into a unified platform.

Its popularity stems from its seamless developer experience, powerful automation tools, and compatibility with modern frameworks like **React**, **Vue**, **Svelte**, and others.

---

## 🕰️ HISTORY AND BACKGROUND

Netlify was founded in **2014** by **Mathias Biilmann** and **Christian Bach**, originally under the name _MakerLoop_. The product launched in **2015** and quickly gained traction among JAMstack developers.

Netlify helped popularize the **JAMstack** (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup) architecture. Unlike traditional hosts, it focused on **Git-based workflows**, **serverless architecture**, and **continuous deployment** — now powering millions of projects globally.
