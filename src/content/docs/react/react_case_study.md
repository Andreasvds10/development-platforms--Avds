History:
In 2011 the Facebook had issues with code maintenance due to increasing numbers of features. The growing number of team-members and app-features slowed them down so over time their app became difficult to maintain.The engineers could not keep up with the cascading updates.
-cascading updates ensure that when a primary key in a parent table changes, the related foreign keys in child tables are automatically updated to maintain data integrity.

- React was created by Jordan Walke, initially called "F-Bolt" then "FaxJS". Deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011, then integrated on instagram in 2012. In 2013 the project is officially open-sourced.Most of this was done by Pete Hunt.

-2014 React developer tools: Now you able to monitor your react code via Chrome DevTools, here you are able to select root components and sub components(more on that later), here you are also able to step through the components with breakpoints.

-2015 React Native(Mobil:Android,iOS,OWP) was announced at Facebook's React Conf in February 2015 and open-sourced in March 2015.

-2016 React turns mainstream: React 15 was released in April 2016, focusing on performance improvements, particularly with updates to how React handled rendering and the DOM. This helped establish it as a mature and reliable framework. By 2016, React was well on its way to becoming the dominant choice for building modern web applications, a status it continues to hold in many contexts today.
