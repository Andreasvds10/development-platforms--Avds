## Introduction

This is a template for a written case study, please note that this is only a suggestion. Your selected topic may or may not conform to this structure. As a content author or editor you should use your discretion and structure each document in order to convey the most important information in the most effective way.

## Brief History

- **2020 (June)**: OpenAI released GPT-3, a large language model demonstrating the potential for AI to generate programming code alongside natural language. This sparked interest at GitHub, which partnered with OpenAI to create GitHub Copilot, an AI tool designed to assist developers with context-aware code generation.

- **2021 (June)**: GitHub Copilot debuted in a technical preview for Visual Studio Code, powered by OpenAI’s Codex model. Codex, a fine-tuned version of GPT-3 trained on billions of lines of public code, enabled Copilot to suggest code snippets, complete functions, and adapt to a variety of programming languages.

- **2021 (October)**: Copilot expanded to Neovim and JetBrains IDEs, opening its functionality to developers using lightweight and professional development environments. This broadened its adoption among a diverse developer audience.

- **2022 (March)**: Support was added for Visual Studio 2022, enabling enterprise developers to integrate Copilot into their workflows. This marked a step toward making the tool enterprise-ready.

- **2022 (June)**: GitHub Copilot exited its technical preview and became widely available as a subscription-based service. Individual developers could now subscribe, while students and verified open-source contributors received free access. It quickly became popular for its ability to reduce repetitive coding tasks and help developers learn new languages or frameworks.

- **2023 (March)**: GitHub announced **Copilot X**, a significant upgrade powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4 model. The update introduced:
  - **Conversational Capabilities**: Developers could interact with Copilot through chat or voice to resolve issues, clarify code, or generate new snippets.
  - **Pull Request Integration**: Copilot provided suggestions for code reviews and improvements directly within GitHub pull request workflows.
  - **Command Line Assistance**: AI support extended to terminal tasks.
  - **Documentation Support**: Copilot could generate or improve project documentation, further simplifying developer workflows.
  - **Enterprise Focus**: GitHub introduced enterprise-specific features, such as centralized management for licensing, enhanced security, and tools to support team collaboration. These features allowed businesses to adopt Copilot at scale while maintaining governance over its use.

- **Impact**: Copilot transformed software development by streamlining repetitive tasks, accelerating learning for junior developers, and providing advanced debugging and testing support. It also highlighted ethical concerns about AI’s use of publicly available code, prompting ongoing discussions about responsible AI use.

- **Future Directions**: GitHub plans to expand Copilot’s capabilities with deeper integrations into GitHub Actions, AI-driven debugging tools, and support for software architecture design. These advancements aim to solidify Copilot as a cornerstone of the modern development ecosystem.

## Market Comparison

This section can be used to compare the advantages and disadvantages of your chosen tool to other similar tools. You may use subheadings, tables or bullet points to structure your description.

If you are writing about an open source tool, it may be a good idea to compare it to similar proprietary tools. Likewise, if you are writing about a proprietary tool, it may be a good idea to compare it to similar open source tools.

Similarly, a self hosted tool and a cloud based tool with a similar purpose may make for a good comparison.

## Getting Started with GitHub Copilot


### 1. Requirments:
To start using Github Copilot the user needs the following:
- GitHub account (paid or free)
- A supported IDE (e.g., vs code, Neovim, jetbrains, etc.)
- An active GitHub Copilot subscription or eligibility for free access(student or verified open-source contributors)


### 2. Enabling GitHub Copilot
  1. **Subscribe to GitHub Copilot**
  - Go to the Github Copilot subscription page [Github Copilot subscription page](https://github.com/features/copilot#pricing) and activate a subscription plan.
  - Students and open-source contributors can apply for free access.
  2.  **Install the extension:**
  - For VS code, search for “GitHub Copilot” in the Extension Marketplace.(img need)
   - For other supported IDEs, follow the installation instructions provided at [Github.]( https://docs.github.com/en/copilot)
  3. **Sign In:**
  - After installation, sign in to your GitHub account through the extension. This step ensures Copilot has access to your account and IDE.

### 3. Configuring GitHub Copilot
Once installed, configure Copilot to match your preferences:
- **Enable or Disable suggestions:** Choose when Copilot provides suggestions(e.g, on new lines, within existing code etc)
- **Privacy settings:** Decide whether Copilot can use your code snippets to improve its AI models.
- **Keybindings:** Customize shortcuts to accept or reject suggestions quickly.

### 4. Using GitHub Copilot
- **Start typing:** Begin writing code in a supported file type (e.g., Javascript, Python or java). Copilot will automatically suggest completions, ranging from a single line to entire functions.
- **Accepting suggestions:** Press (`Tab`)  or (`Enter`) to accept a suggestion 
- **Exploring alternative suggestions:** (`Press Ctrl + ]`) (or the equivalent keybinding) to cycle through multiple suggestions for the same prompt.
- **Custom Prompts:** Write a comment or plain text description of what you need, and Copilot will generate the corresponding code.


### 5. Advance features
- **Context-Aware assistance:** Copilot adapts its suggestions based on the surrounding code, project structure and coding patterns.
- **Comments to guide Copilot:** Developers can use plain English comments to guide Copilot, e.g., # Create a function to sort an array.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Modify Suggestions directly in the IDE and provide feedback to refine future outputs

### 6. Tips for use of Copilot: 
- **Start small:** Use Copilot for boilerplate code and repetitive tasks. 
- **Combine with traditional coding:** Treat Copilot as a collaborative assistant, not a replacement.
- **Review outputs:** Verify AI-generated code for accuracy, especially when working on critical or sensitive tasks.
