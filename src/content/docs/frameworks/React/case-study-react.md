## Getting Started with React

To start a React project, you should have **Node.js** installed on your system. If you donâ€™t have it yet, you can download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Step 1: Create a New Vite Project

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a fast build tool that offers a streamlined experience for modern web development, especially with React. To create a new React project using Vite, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npx create-vite your-project-name --template react
```

Replace _your-project-name_ with your preferred project name.

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

After the project is created, navigate to the newly created project directory:

```bash
cd your-project-name
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Next, install all required dependencies for the project:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 4: Run the Development Server

To start the development server and see your app in action, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server and the app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` by default.
