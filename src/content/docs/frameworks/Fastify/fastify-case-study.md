## Introduction

Fastify is an open-source web framework for Node.js, inspired by Hapi and Express. It is designed to be one of the fastest web frameworks available, focusing on both performance and developer experience. With a schema-based approach, built-in validation, and an extensive plugin system, Fastify is a powerful choice for building modern web applications.

## Brief History

- **2016** – Co-Creator Matteo Collina stated in an interview that they started working on Fastify in 2016. After introducing Pino at Node.js Summit 2016 in San Francisco, they started thinking about writing a web framework. Initially named "beo" (short for "be open"), they later renamed it to Fastify in September 2016. Fastify was first released in October 2016 with version 0.1.0.

- **2018** – Fastify reached the 1.0.0 milestone after a year and a half of development, signaling its readiness for production use.

- **2020** – Version 3 introduced performance improvements and enhanced TypeScript support.

- **2022** – Version 4 was released, offering improved stability and dropping support for older Node.js versions.

- **2024** – The latest major release, Fastify v5, introduced streamlined features, optimized support for modern Node.js versions, and removal of deprecated APIs.

## Key Features

### Plugins

Fastify has over 260 plugins available, supporting authentication, caching, and data integration. Its modular architecture allows for easy creation and integration of custom plugins.

### Validation

Fastify includes built-in validation and data serialization using JSON Schema, ensuring reliability and high performance. While not mandatory, it is recommended to validate routes and serialize outputs to maintain consistency.

### Logging

Fastify features a low-overhead logger (built on Pino) that delivers insights without affecting performance. This allows developers to monitor applications efficiently without slowing them down.

### Hooks

Fastify supports lifecycle hooks that enable developers to execute code at different stages of request handling. This makes it easier to implement authentication, monitoring, and request modifications.

## Market Comparison

Fastify competes with other popular Node.js frameworks, such as:

| Feature                 | Fastify    | Express.js               | Koa      |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------ | -------- |
| Performance             | High       | Moderate                 | High     |
| TypeScript Support      | Strong     | Limited                  | Moderate |
| Schema-Based Validation | Yes        | No                       | No       |
| Plugin System           | Extensive  | Yes, but less structured | Limited  |
| Built-in Logging        | Yes (Pino) | No (needs middleware)    | No       |

Fastify stands out for its high performance, built-in validation, and well-structured plugin system, making it a solid choice for high-speed applications.

## Getting Started

To begin using Fastify, ensure you have Node.js installed. You can then install Fastify using npm:

```sh
npm init -y
npm install fastify
```

Create a simple Fastify server:

```javascript
const fastify = require("fastify")({ logger: true });

fastify.get("/", async (request, reply) => {
  return { message: "Hello, Fastify!" };
});

fastify.listen({ port: 3000 }, (err, address) => {
  if (err) {
    fastify.log.error(err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
  console.log(`Server running at ${address}`);
});
```

Run the server with:

```sh
node server.js
```

## Strengths and Weaknesses

### Strengths

- **High Performance:** Optimized for speed and low overhead.
- **Schema-Based Validation:** Ensures data integrity and reliability.
- **Extensive Plugin System:** Over 260 plugins for customization.
- **Built-in Logging:** Uses Pino for efficient request logging.
- **Strong TypeScript Support:** Enhances developer experience.

### Weaknesses

- **Smaller Ecosystem:** Compared to Express, it has a smaller community and fewer third-party middleware options.
- **Learning Curve:** The schema-based approach requires some learning, especially for newcomers.
- **Less Middleware Support:** Some Express middleware may not work out-of-the-box.

## Conclusion

Fastify is a powerful and high-performance alternative to Express.js and Koa. Its schema-based validation, built-in logging, and modular architecture make it an excellent choice for developers looking for speed and efficiency. While it has a smaller ecosystem than Express, its advantages in performance and maintainability make it an attractive option for modern web development.
