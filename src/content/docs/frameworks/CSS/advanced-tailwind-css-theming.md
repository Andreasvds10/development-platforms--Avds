# **Advanced Tailwind CSS Customization & Theming**

![tailwind](../../../../assets/frameworks/css/tailwind.png)

## **1. Introduction**
Tailwind CSS is a powerful utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to build modern and responsive user interfaces quickly. While its default settings offer great flexibility, many teams and projects benefit from customizing Tailwind to match their **design systems, branding, and theming requirements**.

This case study explores **advanced customization techniques**, including:
- Setting up a **custom Tailwind configuration (`tailwind.config.js`)**  
- Creating a **design system** with **custom fonts, colors, and spacing**  
- Enabling **dark mode & theme switching**  
- Building **reusable UI components**  
- Exploring **Tailwind CSS Plus** for advanced features  

## **2. Brief History of Tailwind CSS**
- 2017: Adam Wathan releases Tailwind CSS as a utility-first framework.
- 2019: Tailwind CSS gains popularity with Tailwind UI release.
- 2021: Tailwind CSS v3 introduces JIT (Just-In-Time) mode for faster builds.
- 2023: Tailwind becomes one of the most widely used CSS frameworks.

## **3. Tailwind Configuration & Customization**
Tailwind CSS allows extensive customization through its `tailwind.config.js` file. This file lets you extend and override the default styles to create a consistent design system.

```js
module.exports = {
  darkMode: 'class', // Enables manual dark mode switching
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontSize: {
        h1: '2.5rem',
        h2: '2rem',
        h3: '1.75rem',
        body: '1rem',
      },
      colors: {
        primary: '#4F46E5',
        secondary: '#22C55E',
        accent: '#FACC15',
        dark: {
          DEFAULT: '#1E293B',
          light: '#334155',
        },
        light: '#FFFFFF',
      },
    },
  },
};
```

This setup ensures that developers can use predefined styles like `text-h1` or `bg-primary` for consistency across the project.

## Common Tailwind CSS Mistakes & How to Fix Them

### ❌ Mistake: Not Enabling JIT Mode  
Without JIT mode, Tailwind generates **larger CSS files** containing unused classes.

✅ **Solution:** Ensure that `mode: 'jit'` is set in `tailwind.config.js`:
```js
module.exports = {
  mode: 'jit',
  purge: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.js"],
};
```

## **4. Implementing Dark Mode & Live Demo**

![Code example](../../../../assets/frameworks/css/code-example.png)

Tailwind supports **dark mode**, which can be enabled in two ways:
1. `media` (System preference-based dark mode)
2. `class` (Manual toggle-based dark mode)

```html
<div class="bg-light dark:bg-dark text-dark dark:text-light p-6">
  This text adapts to light and dark mode.
</div>
```

**JavaScript for Dark Mode Toggle:**
```js
const toggleDarkMode = () => {
  document.documentElement.classList.toggle('dark');
};
```
