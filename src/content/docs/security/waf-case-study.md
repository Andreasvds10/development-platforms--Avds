## Introduction

WAF is like your website’s super-smart guard that keeps everything safe and running smoothly. It acts like a security guard, checking all the traffic coming to your website and blocking anything harmful. WAFs are important because they stop attacks like:

-	**SQL Injection:** Hackers try to mess with your website’s database to steal or damage data.
-	**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Bad scripts are injected to trick users or steal their information.
-	**DDoS Attacks:** Hackers send too much traffic to crash your website.


## Brief History
* **1990s:** Firewalls emerged to protect networks, focusing on packet filtering; web apps introduced new vulnerabilities.
* **1999:** First WAF introduced to address web-specific threats like SQL injection and XSS with rule-based HTTP filtering.
* **2002:** ModSecurity released as the first open-source WAF, shifting to software-based solutions.
* **2006:** OWASP Top 10 highlighted major web vulnerabilities, driving WAF adoption.
* **2010:** Cloud WAFs launched (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai), offering scalable and cost-effective solutions.
* **2013:** PCI DSS mandated WAFs or code reviews for secure web apps, boosting adoption.
* **2017:** Machine learning-powered WAFs emerged, focusing on zero-day threats and behavior analytics.
* **2020s:** Modern WAFs protect APIs, integrate with DevSecOps, and secure CI/CD pipelines.

## Main Features

A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a security tool designed to protect web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP/S traffic and preventing common attacks.

### Usefulness to Developers
* **Time-Saving:** Automates security, freeing developers to focus on coding.
* **Integration-Friendly:** Easily incorporates into CI/CD workflows.
* **Improved App Stability:** Blocks threats that could disrupt application functionality.

|  FEATURE  | DESCRIPTION  |
|---|---|
| **Protection Against OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities** | Prevents SQL injection, XSS, and other web-based attacks. |
| **Customizable Rules** | Allows users to define rules tailored to their specific applications. |
| **Real-Time Threat Monitoring** | Monitors and blocks malicious activity in live traffic. |
| **Cloud-Based WAF Options** | Provides scalable and hardware-free security solutions. |
| **API Security** | Safeguards APIs and microservices from common threats.! |
| **Automated Threat Detection** | Uses machine learning to detect zero-day and emerging attacks. |

### Related Terms to Understand WAF
  
**HTTP/S:** *The protocol used for transferring data over the web. HTTPS is the secure version, encrypting communication (handshake) between the user and the server.*

**SQL Injection:** *An attack where hackers manipulate SQL queries to access or damage a database.*

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** *An attack where malicious scripts are injected into a website to trick users or steal data.*

**DDoS Attack:** *Distributed Denial-of-Service attack, where an attacker overwhelms a website with excessive traffic to crash it.*

**API:** *Application Programming Interface, a set of rules that allows different software systems to communicate with each other.*

**OWASP Top 10:** *A list of the ten most critical web application security risks, maintained by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP).*
