## Introduction

A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is like a smart security guard for your website. It monitors all incoming traffic, blocks harmful activities like hacking attempts, and keeps your site safe and running smoothly. WAFs are essential for protecting against common web attacks like SQL injection, XSS, and DDoS.

## Brief History
* **1990s:** Firewalls emerged to protect networks, focusing on packet filtering; web apps introduced new vulnerabilities.
* **1999:** First WAF introduced to address web-specific threats like SQL injection and XSS with rule-based HTTP filtering.
* **2002:** ModSecurity released as the first open-source WAF, shifting to software-based solutions.
* **2006:** OWASP Top 10 highlighted major web vulnerabilities, driving WAF adoption.
* **2010:** Cloud WAFs launched (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai), offering scalable and cost-effective solutions.
* **2013:** PCI DSS mandated WAFs or code reviews for secure web apps, boosting adoption.
* **2017:** Machine learning-powered WAFs emerged, focusing on zero-day threats and behavior analytics.
* **2020s:** Modern WAFs protect APIs, integrate with DevSecOps, and secure CI/CD pipelines.

## Main Features

A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a security tool designed to protect web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP/S traffic and preventing common attacks.

### Usefulness to Developers
* **Time-Saving:** Automates security, freeing developers to focus on coding.
* **Integration-Friendly:** Easily incorporates into CI/CD workflows.
* **Improved App Stability:** Blocks threats that could disrupt application functionality.

|  FEATURE  | DESCRIPTION  |
|---|---|
| **Protection Against OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities** | Prevents SQL injection, XSS, and other web-based attacks. |
| **Customizable Rules** | Allows users to define rules tailored to their specific applications. |
| **Real-Time Threat Monitoring** | Monitors and blocks malicious activity in live traffic. |
| **Cloud-Based WAF Options** | Provides scalable and hardware-free security solutions. |
| **API Security** | Safeguards APIs and microservices from common threats.! |
| **Automated Threat Detection** | Uses machine learning to detect zero-day and emerging attacks. |

### Related Terms to Understand WAF
  
**HTTP/S:** *The protocol used for transferring data over the web. HTTPS is the secure version, encrypting communication (handshake) between the user and the server.*

**SQL Injection:** *An attack where hackers manipulate SQL queries to access or damage a database.*

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** *An attack where malicious scripts are injected into a website to trick users or steal data.*

**DDoS Attack:** *Distributed Denial-of-Service attack, where an attacker overwhelms a website with excessive traffic to crash it.*

**API:** *Application Programming Interface, a set of rules that allows different software systems to communicate with each other.*

**OWASP Top 10:** *A list of the ten most critical web application security risks, maintained by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP).*
