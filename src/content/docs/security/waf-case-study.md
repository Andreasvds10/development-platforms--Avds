## Introduction

WAF is like your website’s super-smart guard that keeps everything safe and running smoothly. It acts like a security guard, checking all the traffic coming to your website and blocking anything harmful.

WAFs are important because they stop attacks like:

-	**SQL Injection:** Hackers try to mess with your website’s database to steal or damage data.
-	**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Bad scripts are injected to trick users or steal their information.
-	**DDoS Attacks:** Hackers send too much traffic to crash your website.


## Brief History
* 1990s
  - The concept of firewalls emerged to protect networks, primarily focusing on packet filtering.
  - Web-based applications began gaining popularity, exposing unique vulnerabilities beyond traditional firewalls' scope.

* 1999
  - First WAF Introduced: Application-level firewalls began appearing, targeting web-specific threats like SQL injection and XSS.
  - Focus was on simple rule-based filtering of HTTP traffic.

* 2002
  - ModSecurity Released: An open-source WAF for Apache, making WAF technology more accessible.
  - Shift from hardware appliances to software-based solutions.

* 2006
  - OWASP Top 10 Published: Highlighted common web vulnerabilities, leading to increased adoption of WAFs.
  - WAFs began targeting specific OWASP vulnerabilities.

* 2010
  - Cloud WAFs Emerged: Companies like Cloudflare and Akamai started offering cloud-based WAFs.
  - Benefits included scalability, reduced latency, and cost-effectiveness.

* 2013
  - PCI DSS Mandate: Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) 6.6 required WAFs or secure code reviews for web applications, boosting WAF adoption.

* 2017
  - Next-Generation WAFs: Integrated with machine learning to detect and block zero-day threats.
  - Enhanced focus on behavioral analysis and advanced analytics.

* 2020s
  - API Protection: Modern WAFs began offering protection for APIs, responding to the rise of microservices and API-driven applications.
  - Integration with DevSecOps: WAFs became part of CI/CD pipelines for continuous protection during application development.
