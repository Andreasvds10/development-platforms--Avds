## Introduction

Gemini is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot released by Google in 2023. On release the chatbot was called Bard, but changed names early in 2024. When the platform first launched it was only available in english, but in the course of a week expanded to include japanese and korean.

## History
Google's journey in AI chatbots began with the announcement of Bard on February 6, 2023. Powered by LaMDA, Bard was first introduced as a generative AI chatbot aimed at enhancing collaboration rather than acting as a search engine. Bard entered public testing on March 21, 2023, as a standalone web application with a focus on complementing Google Search. By May 2023, Bard adopted the advanced PaLM 2 model, expanding to 180 countries and supporting multiple languages.

In December 2023 Gemini was announced. This newer model marked a big upgrade, introducing features as image generation and deeper integration with Google products. 

## Features
Google Gemini has three versions 
Gemini Ultra — our largest and most capable model for highly complex tasks.
Gemini Pro — our best model for scaling across a wide range of tasks.
Gemini Nano — our most efficient model for on-device tasks.
