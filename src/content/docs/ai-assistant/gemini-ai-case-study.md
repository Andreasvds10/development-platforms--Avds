## Introduction

Gemini is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot released by Google in 2023. On release the chatbot was called Bard, but changed names early in 2024. When the platform first launched it was only available in english, but in the course of a week expanded to include japanese and korean.

## History

Google's journey in AI chatbots began with the announcement of Bard on February 6, 2023. Powered by LaMDA, Bard was first introduced as a generative AI chatbot aimed at enhancing collaboration rather than acting as a search engine. Bard entered public testing on March 21, 2023, as a standalone web application with a focus on complementing Google Search. By May 2023, Bard adopted the advanced PaLM 2 model, expanding to 180 countries and supporting multiple languages.

In December 2023 Gemini 1.0 was announced. This newer model marked a big upgrade, introducing features as image generation and deeper integration with Google products. In the end of 2024 they introduced Gemini 2.0.

## Features

Gemini 2.0 is Google's newest chatbot, and has two versions- The Gemini Flash and Gemini Advanced.

The Gemini Flash is an experimental model that offers enhanced performance and speed, unlocking a more helpful assistant. It supports multimodal inputs and outputs, including text, images, video, and audio. The Gemini Flash has four versions in the flash "family". These include 2.0 Flash Experimental, 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental, 1.5 Flash and 1.5 Flash-8B.

The Gemini Advanced is integrated into different tools in Google, such as Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Chat, and Meet. This version assists with tasks such as summarizing emails, creating professional documents, and taking meeting notes. It also helps with complex projects involving coding, research, or data analysis.

## Strengths

The Gemini 2.0 has many strengths such as:

- Multimodal Capabilities: Gemini 2.0 can process and generate text, images, and audio, allowing for more natural and versatile interactions.
- Enhanced Reasoning: The "Thinking Mode" provides step-by-step explanations, improving the model's reasoning abilities.
- Integrated Outputs: Users can generate combined outputs, such as blog posts with AI-generated visuals and multilingual text-to-speech audio, from a single prompt.

## Weaknesses

Some weaknesses of the Gemini 2.0 include:

- Limited availability. Currently the full access to Gemini is restricted to developers and enterprise customers on Google Cloud platforms.
- Bias and Fairness. Like many AI models, Gemini 2.0 can inherit biases from its training data, leading to concerns about fairness and ethical implications in its outputs
- Data requirements and computational costs. Gemini needs a lot of computing power and large amounts of data to work effectively. This makes it harder to scale and less accessible for widespread use.
