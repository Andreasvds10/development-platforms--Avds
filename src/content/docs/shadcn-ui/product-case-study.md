# Introduction

![shadcn/ui](https://github.com/hvemily/assets/blob/main/shadcn_landing.png)

**shadcn/ui** is a modern UI component library built for React applications using Tailwind CSS. Unlike traditional libraries, shadcn/ui gives you full access to the component source code, offering a unique balance between pre-built structure and complete customization. With accessible components powered by Radix UI and full support for theming and dark mode, it's gaining rapid popularity in the frontend community.

It’s not a traditional npm package – instead, you install components directly into your project, giving you full control over design, accessibility, and behavior.


# Brief History

- **2022**: Created by Shadid Haque (aka "shadcn") as a personal experiment.
- **2023**: Open sourced and quickly gained traction in the React/Tailwind community.
- **2024**: Becomes widely adopted and praised for its elegant developer experience, growing integration with Next.js and Vite.

# Main Features

- **CLI Tool:** Add components using a CLI (`npx shadcn-ui@latest add component-name`), which copies the source into your codebase.
- **Tailwind CSS Integration:** Built entirely with Tailwind. Utility-first classes make it easy to customize.
- **Accessibility:** Based on Radix UI primitives, ensuring excellent accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, etc.).
- **Dark Mode Support:** Theme-aware components using Tailwind's theming capabilities.
- **Fully Customizable:** Since the code lives in your project, you can change anything – structure, styling, or behavior.
- **No Vendor Lock-in:** You own the code. No reliance on external packages after installation.

Example CLI command to install a button:
```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
```

# Architecture & Philosophy

Unlike libraries like Material UI that abstract components into tightly controlled packages, **shadcn/ui** treats each component as a starting point – not an unchangeable tool.

**Philosophy:**

- Give developers full control.
- Prefer composition over abstraction.
- Embrace utility-first styling.

# Use Cases

- **Portfolio Websites** – Quickly style buttons, modals, and cards while maintaining full design control.
- **Design Systems** – Ideal for teams who want consistent components while preserving flexibility.
- **Client Projects** – Build fast without sacrificing accessibility or customization.

# Getting Started

### 1. Install shadcn/ui

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

Choose framework (Next.js is common) and styling (Tailwind).

### 2. Add components

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
```

This installs `Button.tsx` into your components folder. You now fully control how it behaves and looks.

### 3. Use in your code

```jsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

export default function Example() {
  return <Button>Click Me</Button>;
}
```
