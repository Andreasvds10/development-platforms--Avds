## **Introduction**

AI tools are transforming how we write code, and Tabnine has become a go-to assistant for many developers. It uses machine learning to offer real-time code completions, helping developers write code more efficiently and reduce the burden of repetitive tasks. Unlike many of its competitors, Tabnine focuses heavily on privacy, offering the option to train models locally and avoid sending sensitive data to the cloud. This case study will explore the origins of Tabnine, its key features, and how it stands out in the market compared to similar tools.

## Brief History of Tabnine

- **2013:** Tabnine was founded as Codota by Dror Weiss and Professor Eran Yahav in Tel Aviv, Israel. It was created to provide developer productivity tools based on over a decade of academic research at the Technion. Codotaâ€™s platform focused on understanding the meaning of code and used AI-based autocompletion with a semantic approach to generate code.

- **June 2017:** Codota secures $2 million in seed investment, focusing initially on Java-based code completion.

- **June 2018:** Codota launches the first AI-based code completion for Java IDEs, leveraging AI to enhance developer productivity.

- **2019:** Codota acquires Tabnine, which introduced a generative AI approach using large-language models to support a wider range of programming languages across multiple IDEs. Codota shifted from a semantic approach to generative AI for code suggestions.

- **April 2020:** Codota raises $12 million in a Series A funding round, aimed at expanding the capabilities of their AI tools.

- **May 26, 2021:** Codota rebrands to Tabnine, reflecting the company's new focus on generative AI across various programming languages.

- **April 2022:** Tabnine reaches over one million users and introduces next-generation AI models capable of predicting full lines and snippets of code. The same year, Tabnine raises $15.5 million in a funding round co-led by Qualcomm Ventures.

- **June 2023:** Tabnine introduces an AI-powered chat agent, enabling developers to interact using natural language for code generation, code explanations, test generation, documentation, and code fixes.

- **November 2023:** Tabnine closes a Series B funding round, raising $25 million to scale the company's operations and expand their AI offerings.

- **February 2024:** Tabnine unveils personalized code recommendations through local code awareness, along with recommendations for engineering teams using integrations with their global codebase.

- **April 2024:** Tabnine releases the option for users to select the underlying AI model that powers their development chat agent, offering custom models from Tabnine as well as third-party models from Mistral and OpenAI.
