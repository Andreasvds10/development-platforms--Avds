## Introduction

This case study will dive deeper into Google Authentication, what it is, its history, and how it works. I will also go through the pros and cons, and compare it to other similar products. First of all, what do we mean by "Authentication" in Development Platforms?

Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity. By asking the user for either an email or a username and password. The server can check the provided details against a database or an external service[1].

There are several types of authentications like local, third-party and passwordless authentication but also "MFA". MFA stands for multi-factor authentication. It is an authentication process that is built upon using multiple means of identification to ensure a user's identity[1]. Google Authenticator is a MFA, but how does it work?

### What is Google Authenticator?

Google Authenticator is a free mobile app that utilize the most common MFA approach, which is two-factor authentication (2FA). The 2FA method requires two forms of identification to verify the identify of a user. The two forms of identification can be either of these:

1. A PIN or password[1].
2. A mobile device or other device[1].
3. Biometric data - voice recognition, fingerprint or retina scan[1].
4. Security questions[1].

The Google Authenticator app generates a 6-digit code which is a time-based one-time password (TOTP). To confirm a user's identity and gain access to their accounts, resources, or data, the user must enter the code in addition to their login details, such as their username and password[2].
