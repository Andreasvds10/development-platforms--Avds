*Preact's lightweight philosophy is reflected in its minimalist branding.*

As a front-end development student who hasn't yet learned React, I was curious about Preact — a library that promises the same functionality as React but with a much smaller size.  
This case study is based **purely on research** as I explore the topic **before starting React** in my front-end studies. It aims to highlight what makes Preact unique, who it’s for, and how it compares to other popular JavaScript frameworks.

**Student Insight**  
> As someone new to frontend frameworks:  
 - Preact's small size makes concepts less intimidating  
 - The React-like API means skills transfer to bigger projects  
 - Perfect for experimenting before diving into React

## Brief History  

- **2013** – Created by Jason Miller as a lightweight React alternative  
- **2015** – First stable release  
- **2017** – Preact CLI introduced for easier project setup  
- **2020–2024** – Active development continues with an open-source community supporting it

## Getting Started  

Here’s how developers typically set up a Preact project:

<a href="https://github.com/preactjs/preact-cli" aria-label="Preact CLI GitHub repository">
  <img src="https://www.svgrepo.com/show/349481/preact.svg" alt="Preact CLI logo" width="120" />
</a>




```bash
npm install -g preact-cli
preact create default my-preact-app
cd my-preact-app
npm install
npm run dev
```
This command will launch a dev server at http://localhost:8080
You can view the app in your browser.

## Basic Component Example (from research)

Though I haven’t used Preact myself yet, I explored how components work. Here’s a basic example:

```jsx
// HelloWorld.jsx - Basic Preact Functional Component
export default function HelloWorld() {
  // Returns JSX (HTML-like syntax)
  return (
    <div className="greeting"> {/* className instead of class */}
      <h1>Hello from Preact!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Preact vs React - When to Choose What
### Choose Preact when:
- You need a small, fast-loading app (e.g. blog, mobile UI)

- You're building a static site or dashboard

- You're focused on performance over full-feature flexibility
### Choose React when:
- You need a large ecosystem of tools (like Redux, Next.js, etc.)

- You’re working on a large-scale or enterprise project

- Your team is already invested in the React ecosystem

## Conclusion

Even though I haven’t used Preact directly or started learning React yet, this case study helped me understand what options exist in the world of JavaScript UI libraries.

Preact seems to offer a clear advantage in scenarios where speed, simplicity, and size are the top priorities. It also provides a great learning opportunity for understanding React’s core concepts — in a smaller package. As I begin my journey into React, I now know there's an alternative that emphasizes performance and minimalism — and that’s something I may explore for personal projects in the future.
