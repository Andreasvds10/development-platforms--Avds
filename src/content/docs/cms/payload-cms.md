## Introduction

Payload CMS is a headless CMS (Content Management System), created by developers for developers. It was created to fill a gap that was highly sought for and needed in the development marked with it's flexibility and focus on the developer. It is made to provide full back-end control, API-driven with no built-in front-end display, that results in total freedom for the developer on how to use the content. 
Payload is built on Node.js and uses MongoDB as default database, but with some configs, it can also be used with other solutions.
