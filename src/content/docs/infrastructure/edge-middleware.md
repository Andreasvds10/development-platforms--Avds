## Introduction

Vercel Edge Middleware provides developers with the ability to run code before a request is completed, enabling powerful use cases like authentication, bot protection, redirects, and rewriting requests. This technology runs at the edge of the network, closest to your users, making it crucial for performance and security in modern web applications.

## Brief History

- 2021: Initial beta release of Edge Middleware
- 2022: Edge Middleware becomes generally available
- 2022: Introduction of advanced matching patterns for middleware
- 2023: Enhanced middleware capabilities with improved routing
- 2024: Integration with advanced analytics and monitoring

## Main Features

Describe the primary purpose of the tool that you have selected. Which problems does it solve? Is there something unique about this tool? How can it be useful to developers?

- **Request Interception:** Vercel Edge Middleware allows developers to intercept and modify incoming HTTP requests before they reach the application. This enables powerful use cases like authentication, bot protection, redirects, and request rewriting.
- **Serverless Execution:** Edge Middleware functions are executed at the edge of Vercel's network, closest to the user, providing low-latency and high-performance request handling.

- **Flexible Matching:** Middleware functions can be selectively executed based on detailed request matching patterns, such as URL path, query parameters, headers, and more.

- **Integrated Analytics:** Edge Middleware functions have access to detailed analytics and monitoring, allowing developers to gain insights into request patterns and middleware performance.

- **Language Agnostic:** Middleware functions can be written in various languages supported by Vercel, including JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, and Rust.

## Market Comparison

This section can be used to compare the advantages and disadvantages of your chosen tool to other similar tools. You may use subheadings, tables or bullet points to structure your description.

If you are writing about an open source tool, it may be a good idea to compare it to similar proprietary tools. Likewise, if you are writing about a proprietary tool, it may be a good idea to compare it to similar open source tools.

Similarly, a self hosted tool and a cloud based tool with a similar purpose may make for a good comparison.

## Getting Started

To get started with Vercel Edge Middleware:

1. **Create a Middleware File**: In your Vercel project, create a new file named `middleware.ts` (or `middleware.js` for JavaScript) in the root directory.
2. **Define Your Middleware Function**: In the middleware file, export a function that will handle the request processing. For example :

import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function middleware(req: NextRequest) {
// Intercept and modify the request
const response = NextResponse.next();
response.headers.set('X-Custom-Header', 'custom-value');
return response;
}

3. **Configure Middleware Matching**: In your Vercel project settings, navigate to the "Edge Functions" section and configure the matching rules for your middleware function.
4. **Deploy Your Project**: Deploy your Vercel project, and your middleware function will start executing at the edge for incoming requests that match the configured rules.
