## Introduction

Postman lets you execute, test and interact with APIs. 

## Brief History

Postman was first built by Abhinav Asthana, and then developed further with co-founders Ankit Sobti and Abhijit Kane. After experiencing difficulties and issues when working with APIs on his own projects, Abhinav Asthana wanted to create a tool to simplify the API testing process. An early version of Postman was in use in 2012 and available on Chrome Web Store, and from there it got popular quickly. Postman was launched formally in 2014. [^1]

Today, Postman Inc. is the leading API platform and they claim that over 500,000 companies are using Postman. [^2]
