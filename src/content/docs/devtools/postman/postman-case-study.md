In this case study we will look closer at how we can get started with and use Postman. We will look at some examples on how to test APIs and what the benefits of this are. Fist, we'll get a short history of why this development tool was created.

## Brief History

Postman was first built by Abhinav Asthana, and then developed further with co-founders Ankit Sobti and Abhijit Kane.

Today, Postman Inc. is the leading API platform and they claim that over 500,000 companies are using Postman.[^3]
