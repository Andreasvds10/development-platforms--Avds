# Brief History

- 2004: Jenkins began as Hudson, created by Kohsuke Kawaguchi while working at Sun Microsystems. He built it to help solve integration issues in software projects by automating builds and testing.
- 2008: Hudson gained popularity as a powerful alternative to other build servers. It even won the Duke’s Choice Award at the JavaOne conference, highlighting its impact on the Java community.
- 2010: After Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems, disagreements began over who controlled Hudson and how the project should be managed, causing tension in the community.
- 2011:  On January 29, the open-source community voted to rename Hudson to Jenkins. This decision was part of a broader shift to ensure Jenkins' continued development as a community-driven project. Oracle chose to keep developing Hudson separately, resulting in a split into two distinct projects. The first official Jenkins 1.0 release was on February 18, 2011.
- 2016: Jenkins 2.0 was launched on April 20, introducing significant improvements — most notably, the Pipeline plugin was included by default, simplifying the management of continuous delivery workflows.
- 2018: In March, Jenkins X was introduced — a modern version of Jenkins designed specifically for Kubernetes and cloud-native applications, with support for automated CI/CD on cloud platforms.

# Main Features
![Jenkins-features](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f26ae26-6696-404e-b338-b55aa96a352d)

- **Simple Installation:** 
Jenkins is easy to set up and works on different operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux. Since it’s built with Java, it can run almost anywhere without complicated setup steps.

- **Plugin Support:** 
Jenkins' plugin ecosystem is one of its most defining features. With over 2000 plugins, Jenkins supports a wide variety of integrations, including version control systems, build tools, and deployment platforms. The plugin architecture allows Jenkins to easily integrate with tools like Git, Maven, Docker, Kubernetes, and more.

- **Highly Customizable:**
Thanks to its plugin system, Jenkins can be extended and adapted for different workflows. You can build custom pipelines, add security features, or integrate new tools.

- **Distributed Builds:**
Jenkins lets you run builds and tests on multiple machines (called “nodes”), so your projects can be built faster and tested across different environments at the same time.

- **CI/CD Support:**
Jenkins is often used for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD), helping developers automate building, testing, and delivering software efficiently.

- **Free and Open Source**
Jenkins is completely free to use and open source, meaning anyone can download, use, and even contribute to its development.

- **Pipeline feature:**
The pipeline system allows developers to write step-by-step instructions for how their software should be built, tested, and deployed. This helps create more reliable and consistent development processes. A ```Jenkinsfile``` is used to script the pipeline, enabling consistent builds and deployments across environments.

  By defining these stages in a Jenkinsfile, you can version control your pipeline and maintain consistency across builds.

  Here’s a simple example of a ```Jenkinsfile``` that defines a basic pipeline with stages for building, testing, and deploying an application:

  ```groovy
  pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building...'
                sh 'mvn clean package'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing...'
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying...'
                sh './deploy.sh'
            }
        }
    }
  }
  ```

## Architecture (Master/Agent)
![Jenkins-Architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6713021e-969c-464c-ab50-db49756e0455)

Jenkins uses a Master-Agent architecture, which allows it to scale efficiently and distribute build tasks across multiple machines. This setup is essential for handling large projects and improving build performance.
- **Master Node:**
The Master is the central hub responsible for managing Jenkins operations, such as scheduling builds, maintaining the web interface, managing job configurations, and monitoring the status of builds.

- **Agent Nodes:**
(previously known as slaves) are separate machines that execute the actual build tasks. They receive jobs from the Master and can run builds in parallel, speeding up the process.

- **Communication:**
The Master and Agent nodes communicate over secure channels, such as SSH or JNLP. This setup allows Jenkins to handle a large number of tasks concurrently by offloading work to multiple agents!

This architecture enables Jenkins to scale by distributing tasks, reducing the workload on the Master and ensuring faster build times.

## Jenkins Use-Cases
