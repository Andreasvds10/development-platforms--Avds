# Introduction

Jenkins is a free, open-source automation server widely used for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD). It helps developers streamline tasks such as building, testing, and deploying software, making the development process faster, more reliable, and less error-prone.

Jenkins is written entirely in Java and is maintained by the Jenkins community under the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF). Thanks to its flexibility, Jenkins supports over 2,000 plugins, allowing integration with popular tools like GitHub, GitLab, Docker, Bitbucket, and Slack.

Its strong plugin ecosystem and active community make Jenkins a powerful tool for automating the entire software delivery pipeline.

# Brief History

- 2004: Jenkins began as Hudson, created by Kohsuke Kawaguchi while working at Sun Microsystems. He built it to help solve integration issues in software projects by automating builds and testing.
- 2008: Hudson gained popularity as a powerful alternative to other build servers. It even won the Duke’s Choice Award at the JavaOne conference, highlighting its impact on the Java community.
- 2010: After Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems, disagreements began over who controlled Hudson and how the project should be managed, causing tension in the community.
- 2011: On January 29, the open-source community voted to rename Hudson to Jenkins. Oracle chose to keep developing Hudson separately, which led to a split into two separate projects. The first official Jenkins 1.0 release was on February 18, 2011.
- 2016: Jenkins 2.0 was launched on April 20, bringing big improvements — most importantly, the Pipeline plugin was included by default. This made it easier to define and manage continuous delivery workflows.
- 2018: In March, Jenkins X was introduced — a modern version of Jenkins designed specifically for Kubernetes and cloud-native applications, with support for automated CI/CD on cloud platforms.

# Main Features
![Jenkins-features](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f26ae26-6696-404e-b338-b55aa96a352d)

- **Simple Installation:** 
Jenkins is easy to set up and works on different operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux. Since it’s built with Java, it can run almost anywhere without complicated setup steps.

- **Plugin Support:** 
It comes with a built-in web interface that makes it easy to configure projects, manage settings, and keep track of jobs. It also provides helpful error messages and guidance.

- **Highly Customizable:**
Thanks to its plugin system, Jenkins can be extended and adapted for different workflows. You can build custom pipelines, add security features, or integrate new tools.

- **Distributed Builds:**
Jenkins lets you run builds and tests on multiple machines (called “nodes”), so your projects can be built faster and tested across different environments at the same time.

- **CI/CD Support:**
Jenkins is often used for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD), helping developers automate building, testing, and delivering software efficiently.

- **Pipeline feature:**
The pipeline system allows developers to write step-by-step instructions for how their software should be built, tested, and deployed. This helps create more reliable and consistent development processes.

- **Free and Open Source**
Jenkins is completely free to use and open source, meaning anyone can download, use, and even contribute to its development.

## Architecture (Master/Agent)
![Jenkins-Architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6713021e-969c-464c-ab50-db49756e0455)

Jenkins uses a Master-Agent architecture, which allows it to scale efficiently and distribute build tasks across multiple machines. This setup is essential for handling large projects and improving build performance.
- **Master Node:**
The Master is the central hub responsible for managing Jenkins operations, such as scheduling builds, maintaining the web interface, managing job configurations, and monitoring the status of builds.

- **Agent Nodes:**
(previously known as slaves) are separate machines that execute the actual build tasks. They receive jobs from the Master and can run builds in parallel, speeding up the process.

- **Communication:**
The Master and Agent nodes communicate over secure channels, such as SSH or JNLP. This setup allows Jenkins to handle a large number of tasks concurrently by offloading work to multiple agents!

This architecture enables Jenkins to scale by distributing tasks, reducing the workload on the Master and ensuring faster build times.

## Jenkins Use-Cases
Jenkins has a wide range of applications in modern software development workflows. Below are some of the most common ways it's used:

- **Continuous Integration (CI):**
*Use Case:* Automating builds and tests when code changes — this is core CI functionality.

- **Continuous Delivery & Deployment (CD):**
*Use Case:* Automating the release of applications to environments (CD) — a separate and essential use of Jenkins.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
*Use Case:* Automating infrastructure setup and management through scripts and tools like Terraform — Jenkins orchestrates these tasks.

- **Containerization & Orchestration:**
*Use Case:* Managing builds and deployments in Docker and Kubernetes environments — a modern DevOps approach supported by Jenkins.

- **Pipeline as Code:**
*Use Case:* Defining CI/CD workflows as code (Jenkinsfile), supporting version control, multibranch workflows, and parallel execution.


# Market Comparison

This section can be used to compare the advantages and disadvantages of your chosen tool to other similar tools. You may use subheadings, tables or bullet points to structure your description.

If you are writing about an open source tool, it may be a good idea to compare it to similar proprietary tools. Likewise, if you are writing about a proprietary tool, it may be a good idea to compare it to similar open source tools.

Similarly, a self hosted tool and a cloud based tool with a similar purpose may make for a good comparison.

# Getting Started
To begin using Jenkins, follow these steps to get it installed, configured, and running on your local machine. This process will allow you to automate your software build and deployment pipelines. I also highly recommend checking out the official Jenkins documentation for the latest setup details, as Jenkins has many features and customization options. 

### 1. Install Jenkins
- **Windows:** Download the Jenkins ```.msi``` installer from Jenkins Downloads. Run the installer, which will automatically set Jenkins as a Windows service.

- **macOS:** The easiest way is to install Jenkins via Homebrew by running the command:

  ```brew install jenkins-lts```

  Alternatively, you can download the .war file and run it directly using Java:

  ```java -jar jenkins.war```

- **Linux:** For Debian/Ubuntu, run the following commands to install Jenkins:

  ```sudo apt update```
  
  ```sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk```
  
  ```sudo apt install jenkins```
  
  Ensure that Jenkins is running with:
  
  ```sudo systemctl start jenkins```

### 2. Access Jenkins
   Once Jenkins is installed, open your browser and visit:
   
  ```http://localhost:8080``` (for local installations)

  The first time you access Jenkins, you'll need to unlock it by providing a key found in the installation directory:
  - On Windows, the key can be found in ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins\secrets\initialAdminPassword```
  - On MacOS/Linux, the key can be found at ```/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword```

### 3.  Install Suggested Plugins
After unlocking Jenkins, you’ll be prompted to install plugins. You can choose to install the suggested plugins or select specific ones     later. The suggested plugins provide the most commonly used tools to start automating builds.

### 4. Create an Admin User
It's important to create an admin user for security purposes. This user will be able to configure Jenkins and set up projects.

### 5. Set Up Your First Job
Once the setup is complete, you can create your first Jenkins job:
  - **Freestyle Project:** This is a simple job type where you can define build steps, tests, and deploy actions.
  - **Pipeline:** More advanced users can define build pipelines using a Jenkinsfile, which offers greater flexibility for complex workflows.

### 6. Monitor Your Builds

Jenkins provides an interface for monitoring the progress of your builds. You’ll be able to view logs and details about the success or     failure of each job.

As you get more familiar with Jenkins, you can use Jenkins Pipelines to model your Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflows. Pipelines are defined in a Jenkinsfile and allow for more sophisticated automation workflows.
