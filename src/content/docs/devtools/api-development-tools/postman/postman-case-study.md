## Introduction

This case study explores Postman, a powerful development platform for APIs. Postman simplifies the process of executing, testing, and interacting with APIs through an intuitive, visual interface, making it an excellent choice for beginners. It allows developers to set up and organize APIs, test their functionality, and explore their capabilities before integrating them into projects.

The study will guide readers on how to get started with Postman, including setup and initial use, and provide examples of testing APIs. (Additionally, it will highlight the practical benefits of using this tool, such as improving efficiency and ensuring API reliability.) To set the stage, we’ll first delve into the origins of Postman and why it was created.

## Brief History

Postman was first built by Abhinav Asthana, and then developed further with co-founders Ankit Sobti and Abhijit Kane. After experiencing difficulties and issues when working with APIs on his own projects, Abhinav Asthana wanted to create a tool to simplify the API testing process. An early version of Postman was in use in 2012 and available on Chrome Web Store, and from there it got popular quickly.[^1] Postman was formally founded in 2014.[^2]

Today, Postman Inc. is the leading API platform and they claim that over 500,000 companies are using Postman.[^3]

## Main Features

Postman gives the users many options without complicating the experience. The primary purpose of Postman is to make the testing of APIs easy. Here are some of the main features:

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Postman has a intuitive, visual design that simplifies working with APIs, even for developers new to API testing. It's available as a desktop app, web app, and browser extension.
- **API Testing and Debugging:** Postman easily sends requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and analyze responses to verify API functionality and identify issues.
- **Collections for Organization:** We can group API requests into collections for better organization, reusability, and sharing with team members.
- **Environment Variables:** Store values like URLs or keys in variables, so you can easily switch between settings for different stages of development, such as development, testing, or production.
- **Automated Testing:** Create test scripts to automate repetitive API testing tasks and ensure consistent results.
- **API Documentation:** Generate and share professional API documentation automatically based on your collections.
- **Mock Servers:** Simulate API responses without needing the actual backend, enabling early-stage development and testing.
- **Monitoring:** Schedule regular API tests to monitor performance and functionality over time.
- **Integration with CI/CD Pipelines:** It is possible to connect Postman with tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions to automatically test APIs as part of the development and deployment process.
- **Learning Tools:** Interactive features like Postman Academy help developers learn how to work with APIs more effectively.

### Pricing

Postman offers a **free** plan designed for individuals or small teams of up to three members. While it has some limitations, such as restrictions on collaborators, packages, and collection runs, it provides a solid starting point for simplifying API workflows.[^4]

For additional features, Postman offers three paid plans: **Basic**, **Professional**, and **Enterprise**. These include everything in the free plan plus advanced tools. Visit [Postman's pricing page](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) for detailed information about each plan.
